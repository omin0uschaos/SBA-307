        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <img src="/images/storyimages/storyscene1.png" alt="Dr on Enceladus" style="float: left; height: 400px;">
        <h2>Our Odyssey Begins: A Vision Birthed from the Stars</h2>
        <p>In the infinite expanse of space, on the icy surface of Enceladus, one of Saturn's enigmatic moons, a spark of inspiration ignited. It was here that Dr. Leonidas Valtor, a visionary hydro-engineer and an ardent environmentalist, uncovered a revelation that would change the course of how humanity interacted with one of its most precious resources: water.</p>
        
        <h2>Dr. Leonidas Valtor: The Man Behind the Mission</h2>
        <p>Dr. Valtor, with his boundless curiosity and academic brilliance, graduated with top honors from the Celestial University of Advanced Sciences. Specializing in Astro-Hydrodynamics, his research focused on extraterrestrial water sources and their potential applications in sustaining life beyond Earth. It was during a research expedition on Enceladus that Dr. Valtor discovered unique properties in the moon's water - properties that held the key to revolutionary hydration technology.</p>

        <h2>The Enceladus Epiphany: A Discovery that Sparked Innovation</h2>
        <p>Enceladus, with its icy geysers and subsurface ocean, presented a unique opportunity. Dr. Valtor's studies revealed that the water here was not just pure; it was infused with minerals and elements that when harnessed correctly, could offer unparalleled benefits to plant life. This groundbreaking discovery laid the foundation for AquaNex.</p>
