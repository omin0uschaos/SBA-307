# SBA 307 (AquaNex Website) README

## Project Description

This README outlines the design process for the AquaNex website, created as part of the Software Engineering Bootcamp at Per Scholas for the assignment SBA 307. The concept for AquaNex stems from a video game backstory lore that I created for a sci-fi game project titled "Drifting Into The Void." AquaNex is a cutting-edge, futuristic website dedicated to showcasing and selling advanced watering systems and related products for space gardens. Inspired by the discovery of unique water properties on Saturn's moon Enceladus, AquaNex integrates this extraordinary water into its products, offering unparalleled benefits for plant life in extraterrestrial environments. 

## Design Process

### Inspiration

The initial design inspiration was drawn from various websites known for their creative and user-friendly interfaces:

- **Lush.com**: Vibrant and clean designed Product Cards.
- **Lemkus.com**: Sleek Layout, took inspiration for.
- **Rejouice.com**: One of a kind user experience.

### Wireframing

The design process began with creating a wireframe on Google Drawing. This helped in laying out the basic structure of the website and planning the placement of various elements such as the navigation bar, main content sections, and the footer.
